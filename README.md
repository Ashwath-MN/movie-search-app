## Project Description

The Movie Search Application is a simple and interactive web application developed using React.js to search and display movie information. The main objective of this project is to build a user-friendly system where users can search movies, view movie details, and manage their favorite movies.

The application connects to an external movie service (OMDb API) to fetch movie data dynamically and display it in a structured format. Users can type the name of a movie in the search box and click the search button to view movie results instantly. The system displays important details such as movie title, release year, and movie poster.

The application updates the information dynamically without refreshing the page, which improves the user experience. This project mainly focuses on frontend web development concepts such as component-based architecture, handling user input, managing application state, and API integration.

React.js is used as the main technology to build the user interface. The project uses React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage data and control how information is displayed on the screen. The application also demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API using asynchronous operations.
